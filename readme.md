# Broadcast algorithms

This repository contains TLA+ models and Erlang implementations of the following broadcast algorithms from the literature (see Christian Cachin, Rachid Guerraoui, and Lu√≠s Rodrigues, "Introduction to Reliable and Secure Distributed Programming").

The purpose of the models and implementations is to be used as examples for teaching distributed systems, Erlang, and verification with temporal properties using TLA+.
It is not recommended to use the Erlang code in practice, as it has not been designed for performance.
